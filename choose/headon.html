            	You chose to fight the boss head on! Of course you can't destroy it without some sort of strategy. To the far right, you notice a construction site a few blocks away. However, there is an advance of creatures in the way. You successfully defeat the advance, but unfortunately, the leader hears you in battle. He starts to run at you in full speed. You finally get to the construction site. You see two machines: a crane and a bulldozer. You must choose one to defeat the boss! Which one will you choose?
