            	Because you chose to fight defensively, you still have enough energy to move on foot. You walk for a mile until you are tired. You find an abandoned building where you can rest and you sleep through the night. By the time you wake up, you look back to see that the creatures thought you were at your old base! Luckily, they are in perfect range for you to shoot at them. You easily kill all of the creatures in a small amount of time. However, when you turn around, you unfortunately see their leader in a distant view. It's over 50 feet tall and 1500 pounds. Luckily the object of the game is to escape the abandoned city, so you have the option to go around it or fight the boss head on. What will you do?
