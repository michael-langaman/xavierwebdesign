            	You choose to rest! Because you have been fighting all day, you need to replenish your energy. You sleep through the night and then some. By the time you wake up, it's noon. You walk out of the abandoned building to see that In the far distance is the leader of the creatures. It's 50 feet tall and 1500 pounds. The leader is your final obstacle you must pass before you win the game and the simulator. You have the option to fight the boss head on or go around it.
